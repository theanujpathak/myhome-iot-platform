## User Experience

### Before SSO
```
User Journey: 8 applications = 8 passwords
├── Email App (password 1)
├── CRM (password 2)
├── HR System (password 3)
├── Finance App (password 4)
├── Project Tool (password 5)
├── Support Portal (password 6)
├── Admin Panel (password 7)
└── Document System (password 8)

Result: 15 minutes/day on password management
```

### After SSO
```
User Journey: 1 login = All applications
├── Single login ──┬── Email App
                   ├── CRM
                   ├── HR System
                   ├── Finance App
                   ├── Project Tool
                   ├── Support Portal
                   ├── Admin Panel
                   └── Document System

Result: 2 minutes/day, seamless experience
```
