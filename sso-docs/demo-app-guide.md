## Technical Implementation

### Client Configuration
```json
{
  "clientId": "demo-app",
  "name": "SSO Demo Application",
  "enabled": true,
  "publicClient": true,
  "redirectUris": ["http://localhost:3004/*"],
  "webOrigins": ["http://localhost:3004"],
  "protocol": "openid-connect"
}
```

### Key Dependencies
- **keycloak-js**: JavaScript adapter for Keycloak integration
- **axios**: HTTP client for API calls with token management
- **react**: UI framework (can be any framework)

### Integration Pattern
```javascript
// 1. Initialize Keycloak
const keycloak = new Keycloak({
  url: 'http://localhost:8080',
  realm: 'sso-realm',
  clientId: 'demo-app'
});

// 2. Check authentication
const authenticated = await keycloak.init({
  onLoad: 'check-sso'
});

// 3. Use tokens for API calls
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 
  `Bearer ${keycloak.token}`;
```

### 3. Cross-Application Navigation
**Scenario**: User switches between applications
**Flow**:
1. User clicks app switcher links
2. Each app opens with user already authenticated
3. Session state consistent across all apps
4. Single logout affects all applications

**Key Points**:
- True single sign-on experience
- Productivity enhancement
- Centralized session management

### 4. Token Management
**Scenario**: Demonstrate security features
**Show**:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Demo App Won't Start
- Check port 3004 is available
- Verify Node.js and npm are installed
- Run `npm install` in demo-app directory

#### Authentication Fails
- Verify Keycloak is running on port 8080
- Check demo-app client is configured in Keycloak
- Ensure correct redirect URIs

#### Session Not Shared
- Check all apps use same Keycloak realm
- Verify browser allows cookies
- Ensure correct domain configuration

#### API Calls Fail
- Verify Node.js API is running on port 3001
- Check token is being sent in requests
- Ensure API can validate tokens with Keycloak

### Verification Steps

1. **Service Status**: Check all services are running
   ```bash
   make health
   ```

2. **Client Configuration**: Verify in Keycloak Admin Console
   - Go to Clients > demo-app
   - Check settings and redirect URIs

3. **Token Validation**: Check browser developer tools
   - Network tab for API calls
   - Application tab for stored tokens

4. **Logs**: Check application logs for errors
   - Browser console for frontend issues
   - Node.js logs for API issues

## Conclusion

The SSO Demo Application serves as a powerful tool for:
